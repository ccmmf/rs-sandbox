This is a sandbox for code related to remote-sensing portions of the CCMMF project, with an emphasis on fast sharing over worrying about organization. Add and change freely; there are no rules.

Wait, there's one rule: If you start relying on something to the point that changing it could break a workflow, then it's time to move that thing to a non-sandbox repo.
